# Visitor Pattern Project: College Visits

This project is a simple Java application that demonstrates the use of the Visitor Design Pattern in the context of RIT's environment.

## Project Overview
The application models different types of people (students, faculty, and campus visitors) visiting different colleges within RIT. The Visitor Design Pattern is used to allow the addition of new operations (visits) to objects of different types (colleges) without modifying their individual classes.

## Key Components
The key components of the project are:

- **Visitable Interface (College)**: An interface that declares the `accept` operation. This is the entry point which enables an object to be "visited" by the visitor object.

- **Concrete Visitable Classes (SaundersCollegeOfBusiness, KateGleasonCollegeOfEngineering)**: These classes implement the Visitable interface and define the `accept` operation. The visitor object is passed to this object using the `accept` operation.

- **Visitor Interface (Visitor)**: An interface that declares the `visit` operations for all the types of visitable classes.

- **Concrete Visitor Classes (Student, Faculty, CampusVisitor)**: For each type of visitor, all the `visit` methods, declared in the abstract visitor, must be implemented. Each Visitor will be responsible for different operations.

- **Driver Class (Main)**: The entry point of the application where the colleges and visitors are created, and the visits are performed.

## Conclusion
This project is a simple demonstration of the Visitor Design Pattern. It shows how the pattern can be used to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying the structures, providing a flexible design that is easy to maintain and extend.
